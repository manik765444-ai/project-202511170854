# project-202511170854 - Rusty HTTP
==========================

## Description
A no-nonsense, lightning-fast HTTP client built with Rust. Because who doesn't love a good HTTP client?

## Features
* **Async requests**: Send HTTP requests asynchronously, because blocking is so last season.
* **JSON support**: Send and receive JSON data with ease, thanks to our built-in serialization and deserialization.
* **Custom headers**: Add your own headers to requests, because sometimes you just need a little extra something.
* **Error handling**: We've got you covered with robust error handling, so you can focus on the good stuff.

## Installation and Usage
